## Technologies

 - **HTML**
 - **CSS**
 - **Python**
 - **Javascript**
  
We used simple html and css linked files to build the pages and style them. Also, we used bootstrap for wraping the content in responsive way.

For the back-end we used Python-Django, where we handle the authauthentication, DB logic, sent modal forms and many more.

We used javascript for the dynamic content in the site, also we created an anonymos token, so u can shop without even a registration.

## Features
- Responsivness, you can ship in whatever device you would like.
- You have a cart, so u can buy multiple products in same time.
- You have anonymos token for shipping without an actuall registration.
- Creation of product is made very simple, with a lot of description, images and so on.
- Shipping is made in modal form.
- You can check every shipment u have in the DB.
- We used Pixi.js to create a simple raffle(where everyone win)
- And many more(TODO add more)

## What we still need
- React for sure! We got too many incomming requests atm. Also reusable components would be awesome.
- Contact form service.
- Better style for the product section.

## How to Setup
1. Install Git, Node.js, Python
2. Install Django
> pip install Django
3. Get a clone of the repo
> git clone https://github.com/enermax5555/ProMed
4. Install dependancies via node
> npm install
5. You can now go and test it.
> python manage.py runserver

Note that, python3 or pip3 could be also used if problem. 

Pixi.js is supplied within the project so no worries about it.

manage.py runserver will open a server on default port a.k.a 3000.
You can go checked it on localhost:3000. In case port 3000 is busy/closed, just go check in the terminal, where u had ran the server and u will see there which ports is used by it.
